Application Performance Instruction:

when the application runs, it automatically renders 'HOT' type coffee on the page.

There is a toggle button on the right side of the navbar 'See ICED/SEE HOT' that you can click and it changes the type of coffee on the page.

Every coffee is being generated in a card that has its name, picture, description and its ingredient(s).

Some information about the project:
I used an API 'SampleAPIs' to help people that love coffee. I fetched the data from the API and tried to get the necessary information that a USER need to know about a coffee. This application is built with React to help the user and also the developer to code and troubleshooting fast. Due to the lack of time, I couldn't work on the page layout perfectly but I do know that it needs more work to be taken care of.

Thank you!
